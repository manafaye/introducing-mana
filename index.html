  <h1>Introducing Mana</h1>
	<img src="Mana faye.jpg" width="300px" height="350px">

	<p><h3> My name is Mana. I was born and raised between New York City and Abidjan, Ivory Coast. I’m a Capricorn who loves to tell stories. I’m passionate about feature writing in arts, culture, and entertainment, and I’d love to bring these stories to life not only on the page, but also on camera. </h3></p>

	<p><h4><i> My Top Three Favorite Articles </i></h4></p>

<li><p> <b>TIME Magazine:</b> <a href="https://time.com/collection/closers/6564918/issa-rae-hollywoods-unkept-promises/"target=""> Issa Rae and Hollywood’s Unkept Promises </a> - This cover story features producer, actress, and comedian Issa Rae. She’s a mentor of mine, even if she doesn't know it. </p></li>

<li> <p> <b> ESSENCE:</b> <a href="https://www.essence.com/lifestyle/solo-travel-for-black-women/"target=""> Solo Travel Is The Ultimate Form Of Self-Care </a> - The article details writer Tenille Clarke's solo travelling journey after she faced a tragic event. I love to travel and solo travel was always daunting for me, and articles like these are always great for perspective, and encourage me to see more of the world alone.</p></li>

<li> <p> <b> REUTERS:</b> <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/world/france-offers-citizenship-to-malian-immigrant-who-scaled-building-to-save-child-idUSKCN1IT075/"target=""> France offers citizenship to Malian immigrant who scaled building to save child </a> - The story frames citizenship as an award, granted only after an extraordinary act. It exposes how belonging is often treated as conditional rather than inherent for African immigrants in Europe. As a first-generation American whose parents are Senegalese, I’m reminded of how easily my parents gained citizenship through their jobs compared to relatives who’ve lived and worked in the U.S. for decades without the same recognition.  </p></li>
